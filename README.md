Discord bot that can notify you about upcoming events.

At the moment its Starcraft 2 specific. Possibly could expand its borders at a later date

- Use -
- /Opt in - Opt in to alerts

- /Opt out - Opt out of alerts

- /List events - lists the next 7 days worth of events

- /Set Notification - Set the amount of time prior to an event in which youd like to be notified.
  this command must be in minutes. (currently looking into how to best accept input in any format) which would be 1 day 2 hours 30 minutes. So if you wanted a 1 hours notification your input would be 1h. If you wanted a 3 day notification your input would be 3d...
- Bot reads from a specific google calendar. If you would like your event added to this calendar please let me know.






Things that need to be done.

Organize this so its not one big file

Setup MMR range specific Notifications.

Look into other ways of populating the calendar automatically

/List events needs to be time zone specific like the DM's. So according to the user issuing the /list_events command
